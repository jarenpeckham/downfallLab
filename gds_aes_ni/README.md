# Stealing OpenSSL AES keys with GDS

This is a repository for a lab performing a power analysis attack in conjunction with the DownFall vulnerability. The Lab-handout.pdf file contains the actual lab write-up that can be given to students. The dist.py and main.py files are the solutions for the students to create. The dist.py shows the first step of creating and using the distribution whereas downfall.py is the downfall portion of the lab.

Files used currently in the lab:
Lab-handout.pdf, openssl_encrypt_128.sh, bellcurve.py, getQwords2.py, plaintext.txt, makefile, downfall.py and dist.py (solutions)

Files included for the actual attack rather than simulation (not working at the moment)
asm.S, attack_encrypt_128.sh, cacheutils.h, lib.cpp, lib.h, main.c, openssl_encrypt.c
