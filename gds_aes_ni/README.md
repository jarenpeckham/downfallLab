# Stealing OpenSSL AES keys with GDS

This is a repository for a lab performing a power analysis attack in conjunction with the DownFall vulnerability. The Lab-handout.pdf file contains the actual lab write-up that can be given to students. The main.py file is an example solution for the students to create.

Files used currently in the lab:
Lab-handout.pdf, openssl_encrypt_128.sh, bellcurve.py, getQwords2.py, plaintext.txt, makefile, main.py (solution)

Files included for the actual attack rather than simulation (not working at the moment)
asm.S, attack_encrypt_128.sh, cacheutils.h, lib.cpp, lib.h, main.c, openssl_encrypt.c
